# Top-Down-Game-Project
This is a Project for Software Engineering Course which is done as team of 4

We developed a game in Unity. Which is a Top down game with a twist. normally top down games are shooters but our game is a dodger game. 
The purpose of the game is to collect items while dodging enemies.

The game play/game mechanics scripts are all written by me.(Aral Açıkalın)
